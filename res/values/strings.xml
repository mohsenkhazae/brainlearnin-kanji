	<string name="front_door_help_text">
		Welcome to Brain Learnin\' Kanji!
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		If this is your first time running you\'ll want to select the "New Session" button.
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		The \"New Session\" button allows you to select an imported list of kanji and begin quizzing with it. 
		
		&lt;p/&gt;
		The \"Open Sesson\" button presents a list of previously imported kanji sets to select and work from. Often you\'ll only work from a single session at a time, 
		but we here at Brain Learnin\' want to be as flexible as possible.
		
		&lt;p/&gt;
		The \"Last Session\" button will open the last session you worked from without having to select it from the set of imported kanjis. Once you\'ve started 
		working through a kanji set, this is probably what you\'ll always select initially.
		
		&lt;p/&gt;
		The \"About\" button shows you some basic information about the application.
		
		&lt;p/&gt;
		We can also edit the global preferences through the menu. These preferences are inherited when new sessions are created. 
	</string>
	
	<string name="new_session_help_text">
		The \"New Session\" view allows you to select an imported kanji set to start working with. Along with a number of built-in kanji sets, we list here any 
		sets the user has previously imported.
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		To being working with a template, select it from the list, and press the \"Open Selected\" button.
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		If you have a new template to import then select the \"Import New\" button.
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		In addition to opening and importing kanji sets, we can also (for user sets) rename and delete them. Simply long press on an item in the list or pop
		up the menu and select \"Rename Template\" or \"Delete Template\".
	</string>
	
	<string name="import_template_help_text">
		The \"Import New Template\" view allows you to add new template kanji sets. These imported sets will then become available in the list on the \"New Session\" view.
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		Selecting \"Browse To File\" will take you to a file browser. Navigate to and select the xml file to be imported.
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		Once a file has been selected, using the \"Import Selected\" button will, on success, import the given file and add it to the list of available kanji sets.
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		To aid in developing custom kanji sets, we can export a small sample file to the SD card (or wherever) with the \"Export Sample\" button. Use this for great good.
	</string>
	
	<string name="select_directory_browser_help_text">
		We are presented with a simple directory browser. Navigate to the directory in which you wish to export the sample kanji set.
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		Once the target directory is selected, press the \"Select Directory\" button to write out the sample xml.
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		Should you change your mind, the \"Cancel\" button will return you to the previous view.
	</string>
	
	<string name="open_session_help_text">
		Here is a list of all the sessions created through the \"New Session\" view. To continue working on a particular session, select it from the list and press the 
		\"Open Selected\" button.
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		As a convenience, you can use the \"Last Session\" from the initial view to quickly continue the last session opened.
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		In addition to opening a session, we can also rename and delete them. Simply long press on an item in the list or pop up the menu and select \"Rename Session\" or \"Delete Session\".
	</string>
	
	<string name="grading_stats_help_text">
		We have here a list of all the kanji in the session, presented 20 at a time. Each row in the list displays the kanji on the left and three numbers on the right.
		These three numbers represent the Leitner grade of the kanji for オン, くん, and Meanings answers, respectively.
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		To navigate forward or back by 20 kanji, use the \"Prev\" and \"Next\" buttons. 
	</string>
	
	<string name="num_leitner_list_help_text">
		This view provides some information about the number of due questions based on their respective Leitner grades.
	</string>
	
	<string name="session_opened_help_text">
		Once a session is opened, we end up in this view.
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		To study using a flashcard-like interface, select the \"Flashcard\" button.
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		The remaining buttons begin a quiz for the selected quiz type. Once a quiz type button is selected, the app will move onto the main quiz view.
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		The \"オン\" button asks questions for only オン readings.
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		The \"くん\" button asks questions for only くん readings.
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		The \"オン &amp; くん\" button asks questions for both オン and くん readings.
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		The \"Meanings\" button asks questions for the meanings of the kanji.
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		Checking \"Enable Grading\" enables the use of Leitner grading during the main quiz.
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		Checking \"Quick Quiz\" creates a quiz of up to 20 entries, asks each question only once and doesn\'t use Leitner grading.  
	</string>
	
	<string name="flashCard_help_text">
		The flashcard view has two sides. The first displays the current kanji, and the second lists the readings and meanings for it.
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		To switch between the two sides, use the \"Flip Card\" button.
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		To move on to the next kanji, select the \"Next Kanji\" button.
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		To change the kanji in the flashcard set, you need to edit them through the session preferences from the previous view (through the menu). 
	</string>
	
	<string name="mainQuiz_help_text">
		This is the heart of the whole app. The quiz.
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		At the top of the screen we have a progress bar representing the number of completed questions. Immediately below that we have on the left a 
		counter telling us the number of times we\'ve correctly answered the current question. To the right of that we have a counter for the number
		of completed questions.
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		Below that will be either \"オン\", \"くん\", or \"Meanings\" displayed against a faintly coloured background. This indicates the type of
		question being asked (and is really only meaningful when quizzing with both オン and くん questions at the same time).
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		Underneath that we have the current kanji in question and an entry box below in which to input our answer. The entered answer will be verified 
		if enter/return is pressed on the keypad or if the \"Verify\" button is selected.
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		To skip the current question we can use the \"Fail\" or \"Pass\" buttons to simulate an incorrect or correct answer, respectively.
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		After each question the answer will be shown with either a red or green background to indicate if the answer was incorrect or correct, respectively.
		&lt;p/&gt;  
		
		To change the kanji in the test set, you need to edit them through the session preferences from the previous view (through the menu).
	</string>
	
	<string name="scoring_help_text">
		After completing a quiz we end up here for some stats.
		&lt;p/&gt; 
		
		To see the grading statistics of the quiz kanjis, use the \"Show Grading Statistics\" button.
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		A list of the kanji that were answered correctly can be seen by pressing the \"Show Correctly Answered Kanji\" button.
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		A list of the kanji that were not answered correctly can be seen by pressing the \"Show Incorrectly Answered Kanji\" button. We can also cheat on the test and
		mark incorrectly answered kanji as correct through this view.
	</string>
	
	<string name="incorrect_answer_list_help_text">
		We have here a list of kanji that were incorrectly answered during the previous test. Beside each kanji is a letter representing the type of question for
		that entry. The letter \'O\' means オン, \'K\' means くん, and \'M\' means Meanings. At the far right of each row is the kanji index, which is largely unimportant.
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		If we select an entry and press the \"Mark Correct\" button, the selected question type will be treated as if it was originally entered correctly during the
		quiz. Don\'t cheat yourself. However, if a typo found its way into the answer, this is the way to correct it.
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		The kanji are listed 20 at a time. Use the \"Prev\" and \"Next\" buttons to show the previous or next 20 in the overall list.		 
	</string>
	
	<string name="select_kanji_help_text">
		You have the power to decide what kanji are included in the flashcard and quiz sets. Do you want to quiz on all of them, or only the select few you\'re currently
		learning? We divine that here. At the far right of each row is the kanji index, which is largely unimportant.
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		Select the kanji you want to be included in the flashcard / quiz set. Use the \"Clear All\" and \"Select All\" buttons to clear all selections or select all kanjis,
		respectively.
		&lt;p/&gt; 
		
		The kanji are listed 20 at a time. Use the \"Prev\" and \"Next\" buttons to show the previous or next 20 in the overall list.
	</string>
	
	<string name="selectEditKanji_help_text">
		This view allows you to edit the kanji in the session.
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		To edit a particular kanji, select it in the list and press the \"Edit Kanji\" button or use the \"Edit Selected Kanji\" menu item. Alternatively you can long press 
		any item in the list and choose \"Edit Selected Kanji\" from the context menu.
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		Similarly, to delete a kanji we can select it and use the \"Delete Selected Kanji\" menu item or long press a kanji and select the same from the context menu.
		&lt;p/&gt;

		Every kanji is given grades for its オン, くん, and meanings. These grades increment when correctly answered and fall back when not. For each grade there\'s a timeout
		period where the kanji attribute won\'t be quizzed again until expired. Those timeout periods are what we\'re looking at here.
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		Each row corresponds to the timeout length in days (ignoring the time) on the left and the corresponding grade on the right.
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		To edit a particular grade, simply select it and press the \"Edit\" button.
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		Deleting a grade involved selecting a row and pressing the \"Delete\" button.
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		We can also add a new grade by pressing the \"Append\" button. This will append a new grade that is 1.5 times the duration of the last one.

		&lt;u&gt;Num Times To Repeat&lt;/u&gt;
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		To ensure you really know the answer and didn\'t just luck out, we\'ll require you to answer each question correctly (in a row) this many
		times before accepting it as correct. Personally we recommend three, but for a boring quiz you can set it to one.

		&lt;u&gt;Drop All Levels&lt;/u&gt;

		When a question is answered incorrectly, if this is checked then the word cycle count will drop back down to zero. However, if this 
		is unchecked we\'ll only drop it back by one. Don\'t uncheck it.. you\'re only cheating yourself.		
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		&lt;u&gt;Show Word Cycle Count&lt;/u&gt;
		&lt;p/&gt;
				
		If checked, we\'ll show the number of times the current question has been answered correctly (out of the number of times its supposed to
		repeat). This can be distracting and/or provide hints, so you may wish to consider disabling it.
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		&lt;u&gt;Reset Correct Count&lt;/u&gt;
		&lt;p/&gt;
		
		If this is checked, the word cycle count will be altered (based on the Drop All Levels setting) after an incorrectly answered question. 
		If you\'d prefer the word cycle count to not be affected by an incorrect answer, uncheck this.

		&lt;u&gt;Random Flashcard Mode&lt;/u&gt;
